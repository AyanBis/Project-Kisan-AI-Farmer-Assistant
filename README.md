# Project Kisan – AI Farmer Assistance System

Project Kisan is an AI-driven agricultural assistance prototype designed to support farmers with data-based decision-making. The system provides crop recommendations, fertilizer guidance, basic disease insights, input analysis, and rule-based advisory using machine learning and structured logic.  
This repository contains the development notebook and the initial research workflow for building the system.

## 1. Overview

The goal of Project Kisan is to demonstrate how AI can simplify agricultural decision-making for farmers by providing precise, data-driven suggestions.  
The project explores early-stage prototyping, including:

- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Agricultural feature interpretation
- Rule-based and ML-based recommendation design
- System structure for farmer-centric advisory
- Notebook-based experimentation and documentation

## 2. Features

- **Crop Recommendation Logic**  
  Suggests suitable crops based on available environmental or soil features.

- **Fertilizer Guidance**  
  Basic NPK-oriented suggestions using interpreted values.

- **Advisory Flow**  
  Interprets farmer inputs and converts them into meaningful insights.

- **Structured Implementation**  
  Modular notebook with clear sections for preprocessing, feature handling, and logic design.

- **Early Research Notebook**  
  The entire development workflow is archived as a PDF.
